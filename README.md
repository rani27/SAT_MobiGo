# R_MobiGo

This is simple demo application for e commerce . 
The data contains basic e-commerce logic, there are categories/sub-categories for different products.
Products have properties like size,color and ranking.
User can sort producds based on ranking.

Development langauge- kotlin,
Design pattern- MVVM using LiveData,
Database- Room,
Network call- Retrofit.


We can implement below features in SAT, but due to time constraint I have not integrated those.
1.Currently I am making API call only once but we can make it after certain intervals as e commerce data changes frequently.
2. We can add search functionality for products.
3. We can do Product sorting based on added_date as date information is available.

I have not used Tax details as we show tax only on summary/payment page.
